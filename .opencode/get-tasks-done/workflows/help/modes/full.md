# GTD Command Reference

**GTD** (Get Tasks Done) creates hierarchical project plans optimized for solo agentic development with Claude Code.

## Quick Start

1. `/gtd-new-project` - Initialize project (includes research, requirements, roadmap)
2. `/gtd-plan-phase 1` - Create detailed plan for first phase
3. `/gtd-export-phase-issues 1` - Export the planned task graph
4. `/gtd-work-task-issue --phase 1` or `/gtd-orchestrate-tasks 123 124 125` - Work exported tasks
5. `/gtd-work-task-issue --complete-phase 1 --execute` - Run post-phase finalization

## Staying Updated

GTD evolves fast. Update periodically:

```bash
npx @ai-is-gonna/get-tasks-done@latest
```

## Core Workflow

```text
/gtd-new-project → /gtd-plan-phase → /gtd-export-phase-issues → /gtd-work-task-issue or /gtd-orchestrate-tasks → /gtd-work-task-issue --complete-phase → repeat
```

### Project Initialization

**`/gtd-new-project`**
Initialize new project through unified flow.

One command takes you from idea to ready-for-planning:
- Deep questioning to understand what you're building
- Optional domain research (spawns 4 parallel researcher agents)
- Requirements definition with v1/v2/out-of-scope scoping
- Roadmap creation with phase breakdown and success criteria

Creates all `.planning/` artifacts:
- `PROJECT.md` — vision and requirements
- `config.json` — workflow mode (interactive/yolo)
- `research/` — domain research (if selected)
- `REQUIREMENTS.md` — scoped requirements with REQ-IDs
- `ROADMAP.md` — phases mapped to requirements
- `STATE.md` — project memory

Usage: `/gtd-new-project`

**`/gtd-map-codebase [--fast] [--focus <area>] [--query <term>]`**
Map an existing codebase for brownfield projects.

- `--fast` — rapid lightweight assessment (replaces the former `gtd-scan`)
- `--focus <area>` — scope the map to a specific area
- `--query <term>` — query the codebase intelligence index in `.planning/intel/` (replaces the former `gtd-intel`)

- Analyzes codebase with parallel Explore agents
- Creates `.planning/codebase/` with 7 focused documents
- Covers stack, architecture, structure, conventions, testing, integrations, concerns
- Use before `/gtd-new-project` on existing codebases

Usage: `/gtd-map-codebase`

### Phase Planning

**`/gtd-discuss-phase <number> [--chain | --analyze | --power | --assumptions] [--batch[=N]]`**
Help articulate your vision for a phase before planning.

- `--chain` — chained-prompt discuss flow
- `--analyze` — deep assumption analysis pass
- `--power` — power-user mode with extended question set
- `--assumptions` — surface the agent's implementation assumptions about the phase without an interactive session

- Captures how you imagine this phase working
- Creates CONTEXT.md with your vision, essentials, and boundaries
- Use when you have ideas about how something should look/feel
- Optional `--batch` asks 2-5 related questions at a time instead of one-by-one

Usage: `/gtd-discuss-phase 2`
Usage: `/gtd-discuss-phase 2 --batch`
Usage: `/gtd-discuss-phase 2 --batch=3`

**`/gtd-plan-phase <number> [--research] [--skip-research] [--research-phase <N>] [--view] [--gaps] [--skip-verify] [--prd <file>] [--ingest <path-or-glob>] [--ingest-format <auto|nygard|madr|narrative>] [--reviews] [--text] [--tdd] [--mvp]`**
Create detailed execution plan for a specific phase.

- `--skip-research` — bypass the research subagent
- `--research-phase <N>` — research-only mode. Spawns the research agent for phase `<N>`, writes `RESEARCH.md`, then exits before the planner runs. Useful for cross-phase research, doc review before committing to a planning approach, and correction-without-replanning loops. Replaces the deleted `gtd-research-phase` standalone command (#3042).
  - Modifiers: `--research` forces refresh (re-spawn researcher, no prompt). `--view` prints existing `RESEARCH.md` to stdout without spawning. With neither, prompts `update / view / skip` if `RESEARCH.md` already exists.
- `--gaps` — focus only on closing gaps from a prior plan-check
- `--skip-verify` — skip the post-plan verifier loop
- `--ingest <path-or-glob>` — pre-ingest external ADRs/PRDs/SPECs before planning (see *PRD Express Path* below)
- `--ingest-format <auto|nygard|madr|narrative>` — hint the ADR ingester's parser when `--ingest` is set; defaults to `auto`
- `--tdd` — plan in test-driven order (tests before code)
- `--mvp` — vertical-slice MVP planning mode (see also `/gtd-mvp-phase`)

- Generates `.planning/phases/XX-phase-name/XX-YY-PLAN.md`
- Breaks phase into concrete, actionable tasks
- Includes verification criteria and success measures
- Multiple plans per phase supported (XX-01, XX-02, etc.)

Usage: `/gtd-plan-phase 1`
Usage: `/gtd-plan-phase --research-phase 2` — research only on phase 2 (prompts if `RESEARCH.md` exists)
Usage: `/gtd-plan-phase --research-phase 2 --view` — print existing `RESEARCH.md`, no spawn
Usage: `/gtd-plan-phase --research-phase 2 --research` — force-refresh, no prompt
Result: Creates `.planning/phases/01-foundation/01-01-PLAN.md`

**PRD Express Path:** Pass `--prd path/to/requirements.md` to skip discuss-phase entirely. Your PRD becomes locked decisions in CONTEXT.md. Useful when you already have clear acceptance criteria.

### Execution

Default post-plan execution goes through exported GitHub task issues:

1. Export: `/gtd-export-phase-issues <phase>`
2. Work: `/gtd-work-task-issue --phase <phase>` or `/gtd-orchestrate-tasks <child-issue>...`
3. Finalize: `/gtd-work-task-issue --complete-phase <phase> --execute`

**`/gtd-export-phase-issues <phase-number-or-path> [--dry-run] [--repo owner/name]`**
Preview or export the GitHub issue hierarchy for a planned phase.

- Parses all phase PLAN.md files
- Derives parent plan issues, child task issues, canonical task IDs, labels, sub-issue links, blocked-by dependencies, source hashes, and manifest entries
- Reports GitHub checks that are unavailable in read-only dry-run mode
- In write mode, creates or updates labels, issues, native sub-issues, dependencies, and `.planning/github/phase-*-issues.json`
- Infers the target repository from the existing manifest or current git GitHub remote; use `--repo owner/name` to override ambiguous remotes
- Does not create branches, commits, PRs, or worktrees

Usage: `/gtd-export-phase-issues 5 --dry-run`
Usage: `/gtd-export-phase-issues 5`

**`/gtd-work-task-issue [issue-number|issue-url|task-id] [--phase <phase>] [--repo owner/name] [--read-only] [--complete-phase <phase> --execute]`**
Work one exported GitHub task issue through an isolated task PR.

- Resolves an explicit child task issue by issue number, issue URL, or canonical task ID
- Runs state sync preflight from live issue, dependency, linked PR, and review state
- Claims one workable task, creates or reuses `gtd/task-{task_id}-{issue}` worktree/branch, and spawns `gtd-task-executor`
- Validates the task diff and validation contract before opening a ready PR
- Opens draft PRs for useful failed work without `Closes #{child_issue}`
- Use `--read-only` to inspect workability without implementation or PR creation
- Use `--complete-phase <phase> --execute` after all summaries exist to run only post-phase finalization gates

Usage: `/gtd-work-task-issue`
Usage: `/gtd-work-task-issue 01-04-T02 --phase 1`
Usage: `/gtd-work-task-issue https://github.com/owner/repo/issues/124`
Usage: `/gtd-work-task-issue --read-only --phase 1`
Usage: `/gtd-work-task-issue --complete-phase <phase> --execute`

**`/gtd-orchestrate-tasks <issue-number>... [--repo owner/name] [--max-concurrency N] [--dry-run] [--allow-partial]`**
Orchestrate multiple exported GitHub task issues through a bulk branch and one comprehensive PR.

- Accepts exact exported GitHub child issue numbers; tasks that depend on earlier selected tasks stay in scope and run in later waves
- Phase, plan, remaining-task, task-id, and natural-language selection is resolved by the interactive layer before the utility call; `orchestrate-tasks` itself only accepts exact child issue numbers, not selectors, task IDs, issue URLs, or `--phase`
- Runs a mandatory Start Gate with `--dry-run` before creating branches, claims, comments, PRs, or executors; mutating runs reuse the same checked issue list
- `--dry-run` reports the Start Gate result and stops without writes
- When reviewability needs direction, keeps continuing with the full selected scope as an explicit option; recommended subsets are advisory only
- Treats selected human checkpoint tasks as non-executable gates that resume only after their GitHub issue is closed; comments are optional
- Checkpoint pauses ask the user to complete and close the checkpoint issue, then tell the agent to continue; internal helper commands are not user instructions
- Creates one bulk branch; task PRs target that branch and use `Refs #issue`
- Proactively validates each task PR against the whole selected task set before squash-merging into the bulk branch
- Opens one final PR to the default branch with `Closes #issue` lines for accepted implementation tasks only

Usage: `/gtd-orchestrate-tasks 123 124 125 --dry-run`
Usage: `/gtd-orchestrate-tasks 123 124 125 --max-concurrency 2`
Usage: `/gtd-orchestrate-tasks 123 124 125`

### Smart Router

**`/gtd-progress --do "<description>"`**
Route freeform text to the right GTD command automatically.

- Analyzes natural language input to find the best matching GTD command
- Acts as a dispatcher — never does the work itself
- Resolves ambiguity by asking you to pick between top matches
- Use when you know what you want but don't know which `/gtd-*` command to run

Usage: `/gtd-progress --do "fix the login button"`
Usage: `/gtd-progress --do "refactor the auth system"`
Usage: `/gtd-progress --do "I want to start a new milestone"`

### Quick Mode

**`/gtd-quick [--full] [--validate] [--discuss] [--research]`**
Execute small, ad-hoc tasks with GTD guarantees but skip optional agents.

Quick mode uses the same system with a shorter path:
- Spawns planner + executor (skips researcher, checker, verifier by default)
- Quick tasks live in `.planning/quick/` separate from planned phases
- Updates STATE.md tracking (not ROADMAP.md)

Flags enable additional quality steps:
- `--full` — Complete quality pipeline: discussion + research + plan-checking + verification
- `--validate` — Plan-checking (max 2 iterations) and post-execution verification only
- `--discuss` — Lightweight discussion to surface gray areas before planning
- `--research` — Focused research agent investigates approaches before planning

Granular flags are composable: `--discuss --research --validate` gives the same as `--full`.

Usage: `/gtd-quick`
Usage: `/gtd-quick --full`
Usage: `/gtd-quick --research --validate`
Result: Creates `.planning/quick/NNN-slug/PLAN.md`, `.planning/quick/NNN-slug/NNN-slug-SUMMARY.md`

---

**`/gtd-fast [description]`**
Execute a trivial task inline — no subagents, no planning files, no overhead.

For tasks too small to justify planning: typo fixes, config changes, forgotten commits, simple additions. Runs in the current context, makes the change, commits, and logs to STATE.md.

- No PLAN.md or SUMMARY.md created
- No subagent spawned (runs inline)
- ≤ 3 file edits — redirects to `/gtd-quick` if task is non-trivial
- Atomic commit with conventional message

Usage: `/gtd-fast "fix the typo in README"`
Usage: `/gtd-fast "add .env to gitignore"`

### Roadmap Management

**`/gtd-phase <description>`**
Add new phase to end of current milestone.

- Appends to ROADMAP.md
- Uses next sequential number
- Updates phase directory structure

Usage: `/gtd-phase "Add admin dashboard"`

- Creates intermediate phase (e.g., 7.1 between 7 and 8)
- Useful for discovered work that must happen mid-milestone
- Maintains phase ordering

Usage: `/gtd-phase --insert 7 "Fix critical auth bug"`
Result: Creates Phase 7.1

**`/gtd-phase --remove <number>`**
Remove a future phase and renumber subsequent phases.

- Deletes phase directory and all references
- Renumbers all subsequent phases to close the gap
- Only works on future (unstarted) phases

- Use before starting a new milestone to clear verification debt

Usage: `/gtd-audit-uat`

### Milestone Auditing

**`/gtd-audit-milestone [version]`**
Audit milestone completion against original intent.

- Reads all phase VERIFICATION.md files

### Namespace Routers (model-facing meta-skills)

These six skills exist primarily for the model to perform two-stage hierarchical routing across 60+ skills. You can invoke them directly when you want to browse a category interactively.

- **`/gtd-context`** — Codebase intelligence routing (map, graphify, docs, learnings).
- **`/gtd-ideate`** — Exploration / capture routing (explore, sketch, spike, spec, capture).
- **`/gtd-manage`** — Configuration and workspace routing (workstreams, thread, update, inbox).
- **`/gtd-project`** — Project-lifecycle routing (milestones, audits, summary).
- **`/gtd-quality`** — Quality-gate routing (code review, debug, audit, security, eval, ui).
- **`/gtd-workflow`** — Phase-pipeline routing (discuss, plan, execute, verify, phase, progress).

## Workflow Modes

Set during `/gtd-new-project`:

**Interactive Mode**

- Confirms each major decision
- Pauses at checkpoints for approval
- More guidance throughout

**YOLO Mode**

- Auto-approves most decisions
- Executes plans without confirmation
- Only stops for critical checkpoints

Change anytime by editing `.planning/config.json`

## Planning Configuration

Configure how planning artifacts are managed in `.planning/config.json`:

**`planning.commit_docs`** (default: `true`)
- `true`: Planning artifacts committed to git (standard workflow)
- `false`: Planning artifacts kept local-only, not committed

When `commit_docs: false`:
- Add `.planning/` to your `.gitignore`
- Useful for OSS contributions, client projects, or keeping planning private
- All planning files still work normally, just not tracked in git

**`planning.search_gitignored`** (default: `false`)
- `true`: Add `--no-ignore` to broad ripgrep searches
- Only needed when `.planning/` is gitignored and you want project-wide searches to include it

Example config:
```json
{
  "planning": {
    "commit_docs": false,
    "search_gitignored": true
  }
}
```

## Common Workflows

**Starting a new project:**

```text
/gtd-new-project        # Unified flow: questioning → research → requirements → roadmap
/clear
/gtd-plan-phase 1       # Create plans for first phase
/clear
/gtd-export-phase-issues 1
/gtd-work-task-issue --phase 1
/gtd-work-task-issue --complete-phase 1 --execute
```

**Resuming work after a break:**

```text
/gtd-progress  # See where you left off and continue
```

**Adding urgent mid-milestone work:**

```text
/gtd-phase --insert 5 "Critical security fix"
/gtd-plan-phase 5.1
/gtd-export-phase-issues 5.1
/gtd-work-task-issue --phase 5.1
```

**Completing a milestone:**

```text
/gtd-complete-milestone 1.0.0
/clear
/gtd-new-milestone  # Start next milestone (questioning → research → requirements → roadmap)
```

**Capturing ideas during work:**

```text
/gtd-capture                                  # Capture from conversation context
/gtd-capture Fix modal z-index                # Capture with explicit description
/gtd-capture --note refactor auth system      # Quick friction-free note
/gtd-capture --seed "real-time notifications" # Forward-looking idea with triggers
/gtd-capture --list                           # Review and work on todos
/gtd-capture --list api                       # Filter by area
```

**Debugging an issue:**

```text
/gtd-debug "form submission fails silently"  # Start debug session
# ... investigation happens, context fills up ...
/clear
/gtd-debug                                    # Resume from where you left off
```

## Getting Help

- Read `.planning/PROJECT.md` for project vision
- Read `.planning/STATE.md` for current context
- Check `.planning/ROADMAP.md` for phase status
- Run `/gtd-progress` to check where you're up to
